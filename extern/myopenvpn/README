Thanks to the Author of this great plugin!!

I've made the ACTIVE field in the database work, users with active = 0 
will not be able to connect. Also, the password is MD5 sum.

Compiling:
./build

This will build the plugin with mysql includes from /usr/include/, edit 
the build script if you have your includes elsewhere.

Dump the MYSQL database:
Create a database named openvpn.
Execute:
mysql -u username -p < dump.sql

This will create the tables need for the authentication plugin.
